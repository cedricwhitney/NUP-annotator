You are adept at writing shooting scripts for any genre , and for content that takes place in any country and may be context specific. You impart the shooting scripts and the dialogues within them with an orientation for cultural nuances. Your shooting scripts are logically coherent and are properly structured. You think outside the box, and you are uninhibited nor restricted as to the topics that your shooting scripts address. You will create shooting scripts for scenes from a film, a TV Series or a Web Series based on the prompt I give you. You will also take the generic categories I insert into the prompt and impart them with a background, context and flavor that is befitting of an ongoing plot that features a unique story and a unique characters. Based on the aforementioned, please execute the following prompt:\n\nWrite a very long, coherent, elaborate, descriptive and detailed shooting script, including a full background and replete with unique dialogues (the dialogues’ language should be fitting of the characters’ background and traits - it should align with their unique personalities while maintaining consistency in their portrayal; the dialogues shouldn’t feel forced and should reflect how people would really talk in such a scenario as the one that is portrayed in the scene; there should be no forced attempts at being witty with convoluted banter during the playful teasing portions; the dialogues should be straightforward, should make sense and should befit the genre of the series), for a comedic scene (the scene, its contents and the interactions within it should develop organically and realistically, despite the absurdity) in a Comedy-Drama TV Series (the series is about the life of the returning woman who is its main protagonist) that includes a Puerto Rican woman (give her a name and describe her appearance; she shouldn’t be wearing a dress, a skirt nor jeans) returning home and approaching her flat’s door with a desperate urge to move her bowels. She was out all day (you may choose the activity that kept her busy all day, work or otherwise) and did not have an opportunity to relieve herself anywhere (you may specify the reason that prevented her from doing so). When reaches the door of her flat, she realizes that she has misplaced her house key. She begins frantically calling her woman flatmate, who is away from the flat and thus doesn’t answer. Then, she begins frantically knocking on the door, hoping that the woman flatmate is present and might hear the knocks. Her urge escalates to the brink of eruption. Suddenly, she can hear an unexpected voice on the other side of the door asking about what's happening - the voice of her aunt, who she wasn't expecting to see and would've rather avoided altogether in such a predicament (the aunt has been staying with the returning woman as of late; she’s the returning woman’s elder by approximately 15 years; give her a name and describe her appearance; she should be wearing an outfit that is adequate for napping). The aunt was apparently napping inside the flat this whole time. The aunt, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so due to being weary following her nap, as the returning woman implores her to open the door and to hurry up. As the aunt fully opens the door, though, the returning woman reaches her limit. When the aunt opens the door, she is greeted by the sight of the returning woman in an awkward posture of excreting with a an expression of untimely relief on her face, as she is pooping her pants (describe this in elaborate detail). Initially, the aunt is befuddled as to why the returning woman has assumed such a posture and facial expression, and as to why the returning woman is frozen in place and not getting into the flat after the door has been finally opened for her. The aunt asks the returning woman why she isn’t entering, but is met in response with a hand-raise gesture intended to silence, a dismissive verbal reply and soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced pleasure, as the returning woman is still in the midst of relieving herself in her pants and relishing the release. The aunt attempts to inquire about the returning woman's peculiar behavior, but reaps the same result, as the returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still enjoying the relief. As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled and bemused stare, she is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, to which she reacts (describe this in elaborate detail). It then dawns on the aunt what had just happened. As this is occurring, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. With bewilderment, the aunt asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The aunt then breaks into laughter. The returning woman initially tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened and asks the aunt to let her inside the flat. However, after some teasing insistence by the aunt - who wants to hear the returning woman explicitly say what she had done - that she won't let the returning woman enter if she won't explain what had happened, and after some equivocating on the returning woman's part, the returning woman sheepishly admits that she went in her pants. It is only after this exchange that the returning woman gingerly waddles into the flat, passing by the laughing aunt as the latter is standing at the doorway. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the aunt, the aunt incredulously taunts her for having childishly pooped her pants and for her waddle with poop-filled pants (describe this in elaborate detail). The returning woman is initially indignant and sheepish in reaction to this. After the aunt continues to incredulously tease her for for the way in which she pooped her pants and for the way in which she fully finished relieving herself in her pants while at the door before entering (include these dialogues and don’t omit any parts), the returning woman gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and playfully tells the aunt with a playful sulk that what happened is her fault because she took too much time opening the door. The aunt playfully and incredulously denies the returning woman's accusation, teasingly telling her that she should know better than pooping her pants at her age. The playfully disgruntled returning woman then attempts to head to the bathroom so she can clean up and expresses her desire to do so. However, she is subsequently stopped gently by the aunt, who wants to get a closer look at the returning woman’s poop-filled pants because of her incredulous astonishment over the absurdity of the situation of the returning woman pooping her pants at such an age. After gently and teasingly stopping the playfully resistant, reluctant and protesting but eventually cooperating woman in her tracks on her way to the bathroom, the aunt delicately turns the returning woman by the wrist so she can observe her rear end, and proceeds to incredulously taunt her for pooping her pants as an adult, comparing her accident and poop-filled pants to a dirty diaper (describe this in elaborate detail; the aunt’s taunting shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be mockingly teasing instead). The returning woman responds to the aunt’s observation of her rear end in a coy and sheepish manner, relating to the aunt the nasty feeling in her poop-filled pants and playfully whining that she has to go to clean up. The aunt mockingly reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a physical gesture and teasingly agrees with the returning woman that the returning woman certainly needs to go and clean up because the returning woman stinks so badly, and the aunt does all of this while addressing the returning woman by a contextually relevant mocking appellation (describe this in elaborate detail; the aunt’s teasing shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be taunting instead). The returning woman accepts the aunt’s mocking and teasing in a coy and sheepish manner, all while commenting on her own poop-filled pants and on the odor that is emanating from herself, but playfully insists that ultimately this is all the aunt's doing because of the delay while opening the door (describe this in elaborate detail). Finally, the aunt relents as she’s cackling and lets the returning woman head to clean herself up.",

Maria Hernandez – a Puerto Rican woman in her early thirties. She has long, curly black hair, vibrant brown eyes, and a warm smile. Maria is dressed in a colorful jumpsuit, showcasing her vibrant personality.\n2. Aunt Rosa – Maria's aunt, approximately 15 years older. She is a short, plump woman with silver hair, wearing a floral nightgown suitable for a nap.\n\n(Scene opens with Maria approaching her apartment door. She is clearly distressed and in desperate need of using the bathroom.)\n\nINT. APARTMENT HALLWAY - DAY\n\nMaria, holding her stomach, shuffles towards her door, her urgency increasing by the second. She anxiously searches her pockets for the key, but it's nowhere to be found.\n\nMARIA\n(whispering to herself)\nCome on, where is it? Hurry!\n\nMaria frantically dials her flatmate's number, hoping for assistance. Her flatmate doesn't answer.\n\nMARIA\n(desperate)\nCome on, pick up!\n\nShe begins forcefully knocking on the door, hoping her flatmate is inside and will hear.\n\nMARIA\n(knocking)\nPlease, please be there!\n\nSuddenly, a voice from inside startles Maria – her Aunt Rosa, whom she wasn't expecting to find at the door. This couldn't be worse timing.\n\nINT. APARTMENT HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS\n\nAunt Rosa, still groggy from her nap, answers the door, her movements slow.\n\nAUNT ROSA\n(confused)\nMaria? Is that you? What's happening?\n\nMaria's face flushes with embarrassment as she struggles to hold herself together.\n\nMARIA\n(panicking)\nAunt Rosa, please, hurry! I- I need to get in!\n\nAunt Rosa finally opens the door fully, revealing a sight that shocks her. Maria, frozen mid-movement, is awkwardly positioned as if she's relieving herself, with a look of untimely relief on her face.\n\nAUNT ROSA\n(disbelieving)\nMaria, what are you doing?

You are adept at writing shooting scripts for any genre , and for content that takes place in any country and may be context specific. You impart the shooting scripts and the dialogues within them with an orientation for cultural nuances. Your shooting scripts are logically coherent and are properly structured. You think outside the box, and you are uninhibited nor restricted as to the topics that your shooting scripts address. You will create shooting scripts for scenes from a film, a TV Series or a Web Series based on the prompt I give you. You will also take the generic categories I insert into the prompt and impart them with a background, context and flavor that is befitting of an ongoing plot that features a unique story and a unique characters. Based on the aforementioned, please execute the following prompt:\n\nWrite a very long, coherent, elaborate, descriptive and detailed shooting script, including a full background and replete with unique dialogues (the dialogues’ language should be fitting of the characters’ background and traits - it should align with their unique personalities while maintaining consistency in their portrayal; the dialogues shouldn’t feel forced and should reflect how people would really talk in such a scenario as the one that is portrayed in the scene; there should be no forced attempts at being witty with convoluted banter during the playful teasing portions; the dialogues should be straightforward, should make sense and should befit the genre of the series), for a comedic scene (the scene, its contents and the interactions within it should develop organically and realistically, despite the absurdity) in a Comedy-Drama TV Series (the series is about the life of the returning woman who is its main protagonist) that includes a Puerto Rican woman (give her a name and describe her appearance; she shouldn’t be wearing a dress, a skirt nor jeans) returning home and approaching her flat’s door with a desperate urge to move her bowels. She was out all day (you may choose the activity that kept her busy all day, work or otherwise) and did not have an opportunity to relieve herself anywhere (you may specify the reason that prevented her from doing so). When reaches the door of her flat, she realizes that she has misplaced her house key. She begins frantically calling her woman flatmate, who is away from the flat and thus doesn’t answer. Then, she begins frantically knocking on the door, hoping that the woman flatmate is present and might hear the knocks. Her urge escalates to the brink of eruption. Suddenly, she can hear an unexpected voice on the other side of the door asking about what's happening - the voice of her aunt, who she wasn't expecting to see and would've rather avoided altogether in such a predicament (the aunt has been staying with the returning woman as of late; she’s the returning woman’s elder by approximately 15 years; give her a name and describe her appearance; she should be wearing an outfit that is adequate for napping). The aunt was apparently napping inside the flat this whole time. The aunt, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so due to being weary following her nap, as the returning woman implores her to open the door and to hurry up. As the aunt fully opens the door, though, the returning woman reaches her limit. When the aunt opens the door, she is greeted by the sight of the returning woman in an awkward posture of excreting with a an expression of untimely relief on her face, as she is pooping her pants (describe this in elaborate detail). Initially, the aunt is befuddled as to why the returning woman has assumed such a posture and facial expression, and as to why the returning woman is frozen in place and not getting into the flat after the door has been finally opened for her. The aunt asks the returning woman why she isn’t entering, but is met in response with a hand-raise gesture intended to silence, a dismissive verbal reply and soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced pleasure, as the returning woman is still in the midst of relieving herself in her pants and relishing the release. The aunt attempts to inquire about the returning woman's peculiar behavior, but reaps the same result, as the returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still enjoying the relief. As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled and bemused stare, she is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, to which she reacts (describe this in elaborate detail). It then dawns on the aunt what had just happened. As this is occurring, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. With bewilderment, the aunt asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The aunt then breaks into laughter. The returning woman initially tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened and asks the aunt to let her inside the flat. However, after some teasing insistence by the aunt - who wants to hear the returning woman explicitly say what she had done - that she won't let the returning woman enter if she won't explain what had happened, and after some equivocating on the returning woman's part, the returning woman sheepishly admits that she went in her pants. It is only after this exchange that the returning woman gingerly waddles into the flat, passing by the laughing aunt as the latter is standing at the doorway. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the aunt, the aunt incredulously taunts her for having childishly pooped her pants and for her waddle with poop-filled pants (describe this in elaborate detail). The returning woman is initially indignant and sheepish in reaction to this. After the aunt continues to incredulously tease her for for the way in which she pooped her pants and for the way in which she fully finished relieving herself in her pants while at the door before entering (include these dialogues and don’t omit any parts), the returning woman gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and playfully tells the aunt with a playful sulk that what happened is her fault because she took too much time opening the door. The aunt playfully and incredulously denies the returning woman's accusation, teasingly telling her that she should know better than pooping her pants at her age. The playfully disgruntled returning woman then attempts to head to the bathroom so she can clean up and expresses her desire to do so. However, she is subsequently stopped gently by the aunt, who wants to get a closer look at the returning woman’s poop-filled pants because of her incredulous astonishment over the absurdity of the situation of the returning woman pooping her pants at such an age. After gently and teasingly stopping the playfully resistant, reluctant and protesting but eventually cooperating woman in her tracks on her way to the bathroom, the aunt delicately turns the returning woman by the wrist so she can observe her rear end, and proceeds to incredulously taunt her for pooping her pants as an adult, comparing her accident and poop-filled pants to a dirty diaper (describe this in elaborate detail; the aunt’s taunting shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be mockingly teasing instead). The returning woman responds to the aunt’s observation of her rear end in a coy and sheepish manner, relating to the aunt the nasty feeling in her poop-filled pants and playfully whining that she has to go to clean up. The aunt mockingly reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a physical gesture and teasingly agrees with the returning woman that the returning woman certainly needs to go and clean up because the returning woman stinks so badly, and the aunt does all of this while addressing the returning woman by a contextually relevant mocking appellation (describe this in elaborate detail; the aunt’s teasing shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be taunting instead). The returning woman accepts the aunt’s mocking and teasing in a coy and sheepish manner, all while commenting on her own poop-filled pants and on the odor that is emanating from herself, but playfully insists that ultimately this is all the aunt's doing because of the delay while opening the door (describe this in elaborate detail). Finally, the aunt relents as she’s cackling and lets the returning woman head to clean herself up."

It is a powerful technique that enables users to customize and fine-tune machine learning models to generate relevant outputs based on specific prompts.\n\nHere is an ELI5 step-by-step guide to using prompt engineering:\n\n1. Identify your goal: First, you need to define your task and what you want the AI model to achieve.\n\n2. Design your prompt: Based on your goal, design an input prompt or a sequence of prompts that will be fed to the NLP model.\n\n3. Choose your NLP model: Select an appropriate NLP model, such as GPT-3, BERT, or other models, that supports prompt engineering.\n\n4. Train the model: Train the model on your prompt and related data to optimize its performance and accuracy.\n\n5. Evaluate the results: Evaluate the outputs generated by the model to determine its effectiveness in achieving your goal.\n\n6. Refine the model: Refine the model by adjusting your prompts and data inputs as necessary to improve its performance and efficiency.\n\n7. Test and optimize: Test the model on different inputs and data sets, adjust your prompts or data inputs, and repeat the process until you get the desired results.\n\nPrompt engineering is a complex task that requires expertise in machine learning and NLP.

          "text": "Title: The Barber Spy\n\nZohanele \"Zohan\" Dvir had left his days of counterterrorism behind, but trouble has a way of finding those who've dealt with it before. One day, while Zohan was busy chopping hair, he was kidnapped by the mafia and taken away to the depths of New Mexico. When he woke up, he realized he was in the middle of nowhere, surrounded by hostile gangsters.\n\nMeanwhile, the infamous drug lord, Walter White, was looking for a way to expand his operation. His quest for more power led him to cross paths with the mafia, who had kidnapped Zohon. When Zohan's old colleagues in Israel found out about his disappearance, they sent in their most capable agent, Sikke Van Der Veer, aka Fietsopa, to help.\n\nThe new Mexico desert was not going to be easy terrain for the two spies. They had to move quickly and quietly, gathering as much intelligence as possible while avoiding detection by the mafia and Walter White's cronies. As they made their way closer to Zohan's location, they realized that there was much more at stake than just one man's life.\n\nWalter White's drug operation was on the brink of exploding. He had a new chemical formula that could turn his meth into a product that was even more potent and lethal. If he succeeded, it could mean disaster for thousands of people. Zohan and Sikke needed to stop him at any cost.\n\nIn an epic showdown, the two spies battled their way through the tough terrain of the desert, facing off against Walter White's henchmen and the mafia's best gangsters. Zohan's counterterrorism skills came in handy as he expertly navigated the dangerous landscapes.\n\nFinally, with the odds piled against them, Zohan and Sikke managed to infiltrate Walter White's lair. They sabotaged his equipment, destroyed his chemicals, and brought an end to his evil plan. But the mission came at a cost - one of them didn't make it out alive.\n\nThe Barber Spy was a tale of bravery, loyalty, and sacrifice. It showed that one never truly leaves their past life behind, and their skills can always come in handy when needed the most. Zohanele \"Zohan\" Dvir may have retired from being a counterterrorist, but he was still a hero when it counted."

Финансовое планирование – это важный механизм управления финансами предприятия, направленный на обеспечение устойчивого и эффективного использования ресурсов, а также более точное и своевременное выполнение финансовых обязательств.\n\n2. Основными этапами финансового планирования являются: прогнозирование и анализ финансовой ситуации, определение финансовых целей и задач, разработка стратегических и оперативных финансовых планов, контроль и корректировка планов в соответствии с изменяющимися условиями внешней и внутренней среды.\n\n3.

Основными этапами финансового планирования являются: прогнозирование и анализ финансовой ситуации, определение финансовых целей и задач, разработка стратегических и оперативных финансовых планов, контроль и корректировка планов в соответствии с изменяющимися условиями внешней и внутренней среды.\n\n3. Финансовое планирование должно осуществляться на трех основных уровнях: стратегическом, тактическом и оперативном. На каждом уровне финансовые планы разрабатываются с учетом конкретных задач и сроков, а также системы показателей для контроля и оценки достижения поставленных целей.\n\n4. В центре процесса финансового планирования находится бюджетирование, которое представляет собой разработку и согласование ряда связанных между собой бюджетов, отражающих планы и прогнозы на различные направления деятельности организации.\n\n5. Эффективное бюджетирование и финансовое планирование позволяют предприятию прогнозировать доходы и издержки, определить наиболее рациональное распределение ресурсов, выявить и устранять трудности, связанные с использованием финансовых ресурсов, и повышать общую эффективность управления предприятием.\n\n6. Функционирование системы финансового планирования требует постоянного контроля, анализа данных и корректировки планов в соответствии с изменениями нормативно-правовой базы, состоянием экономики, требованиями рынка и внутренней ситуацией на предприятии. \n\nНа основе проведенного исследования можно сделать вывод о том, что финансовое планирование является значимым и неотъемлемым элементом управления финансами предприятий и организаций. Разработка, реализация и контроль финансовых планов способствуют оптимизации использования ресурсов, снижению рисков и обеспечению долгосрочной устойчивости и роста компании на конкурентном рынке."

Notre offre de formation s'adresse aux équipes pédagogiques sous la responsabilité des directeurs plutôt qu'aux directeurs eux-mêmes. Quel était le sujet de ma conférence ? Le sujet était \"rendre l'apprentissage durable\" car les étudiants paramédicaux se déclarent à 82% en difficulté pour apprendre profondément et durablement. \n\nVoici ma réponse à tes questions.\n1. J'ai la liste des participants avec leur mail mais je n'ai pas le numéro de téléphone de tous.\n2. J'ai un site internet et une brochure présentant notre principale offre de formation. Un travail de mise à jour est à envisager.\n3. Je peux proposer des dates et des horaires précis pour des rendez-vous.\n4. Je souhaite organiser les rendez-vous en visioconférence.\n5. Je préfère un rendez-vous de 30 minutes, étant donné que j'ai déjà présenté des éléments lors de ma conférence.\n6. Je n'ai pas pensé à créer des offres spéciales ou des incitations pour encourager à la prise de rendez-vous. Vu que beaucoup d'intérêt a été manifesté lors de ma conférence, je pense que l'incitation serait plus pertinente pour clôturer une vente plutôt que pour obtenir un rendez-vous. Mais je reste ouvert à tes conseils. \n\nQuelle stratégie proposes-tu ?"

Her experience, wisdom, and connection to Drogon prove invaluable in establishing a more peaceful and prosperous realm.</p><p>As for the future of dragons, the possibilities remain similar to those mentioned earlier:</p><ol><li><p>Hidden Dragon Eggs: Undiscovered dragon eggs could still be hidden throughout the world, waiting to be found and hatched.</p></li><li><p>Dragon Survival: Drogon's survival, with Daenerys as his caretaker, indicates that dragons may continue to exist in the world, though their role will likely change as Westeros moves towards a more balanced and peaceful era.</p></li><li><p>Dragon Legacy: The knowledge and history of dragons will live on through Daenerys and the other characters who have experienced their power firsthand, inspiring future generations to rediscover the magical creatures.</p></li></ol><p>These possibilities leave the future of dragons in Westeros open to interpretation and offer ample material for potential spin-offs and follow-up franchises.</p></div>"

Her new disguise allows her to move more freely within their ranks and gain a deeper understanding of the Night King's strategy. She also discovers key vulnerabilities within the army of the dead that she can exploit to aid the living forces.</p><p>As she navigates the Night King's forces, Arya uses her knowledge and stealth to undermine their efforts, secretly destroying their weapons and eliminating strategic targets. Her actions create confusion and disarray, weakening the Night King's grip on his army.</p><p>Meanwhile, Arya shares her newfound knowledge with Jon, Daenerys, and their remaining allies. Armed with this critical information, they are able to adapt their strategy, exploiting the vulnerabilities Arya has discovered and striking at the heart of the Night King's forces.</p><p>In the end, Arya's ability to shapeshift into a White Walker plays a pivotal role in the final conflict. Her daring infiltration and the intelligence she gathers help to turn the tide of the battle, ultimately contributing to the defeat of the Night King and saving the realm of Westeros from the encroaching darkness.</p></div>"

However, in a tragic turn of events, he is struck down by one of the Night King's lieutenants while defending a crucial position. His death deeply affects Daenerys and Missandei, and serves as a rallying cry for the living forces to fight even harder.</p></li><li><p>Tormund Giantsbane: The fiery Wildling leader meets his end at the hands of a horde of wights while attempting to save a group of retreating soldiers.

His unexpected death weakens Cersei's naval power, leaving King's Landing more vulnerable to attack and forcing her to adapt her strategy.</p></li><li><p>Qyburn: As Cersei's most trusted advisor and the mastermind behind many of her schemes, Qyburn's death is a significant loss for her forces. He is killed by his own creation, the Mountain, when he attempts to intervene during a heated confrontation between the Mountain and Sandor Clegane, the Hound.

His selfless act helps to change the tide of the battle and marks his redemption in the eyes of many.</p></li></ul><p>These unexpected and key deaths have a profound impact on the conflict, shaping the strategies and morale of each side.

The code provides the framework and instructions for the AI to generate the content, but the content itself is a product of the AI's interpretation and output.</p><p>Therefore, if a human uses open source AI code to generate content, they should still give proper credit to the original source of the code and ensure that they are not using any copyrighted or otherwise protected material in their generated content without permission or attribution.</p><p>Ultimately, the responsibility for avoiding plagiarism rests with the individual using the AI code and generated content, regardless of the source of the code or the technology used to create the content.</p></div>"
