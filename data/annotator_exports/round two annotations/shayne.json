Activa todo el sistema presupuestario de la empresa y, por lo general, proporciona datos por meses, del área ventas. De allí, la trascendental importancia que tiene la actitud de su cálculo y preparación.  \n\nPrincipio de Consistencia: \n\nEl cual indica que deben utilizarse siempre la misma política, en los procedimientos de contabilidad no deben introducirse cambios constantes, debido a que ello, además de alterar los resultados tiende a confundir al usuario en sus interpretaciones. Asimismo, la consistencia se apoya en el siguiente argumento es necesario contraponer el pesimismo, al optimismo desmedido del dueño y gerente de la institución, la estimación de las ganancias no resultara tan dañina a la organización, como la estimación de sus pérdidas.  \n\n\nPrincipio de Determinación Objetiva: \n\nEstablece que la base para registrar los activos y los gastos deben ser la del costo, de modo que los estados financieros y los registros de contabilidad deben reflejar los costos de adquisición, los de las transformaciones en su contraposición a la parte esperada de tales costos.  \n\nPrincipio del Conservatismo:\n\nEste es uno de los conceptos más importantes, e indica que la institución no debe reflejar beneficios hasta obtenerlos y proveer las posibles pérdidas en el momento en que se presenten. Los ingresos y los gastos deben reflejarse en el momento en que se generan y no en el momento en que se cobran o se pagan.  \n\nPrincipio de Aplicación en el Tiempo: \n\nEste principio indica que los valores mostrados en los estados financieros corresponden a un período de tiempo determinado, y que los ingresos y egresos, corresponden al período en que se generaron.  \n\nEn resumidas cuentas, para que la contabilidad rinda sus mejores frutos y pueda proporcionar Estados Financieros realmente útiles y confiables, se hace necesario acordar una serie de Principios de Contabilidad. Estos principios, si bien carecen de autoridad formal, apoyan la vigencia en el grado de aceptación generalmente que le dispensen los profesionales de la Contaduría quienes están en el deber de acatarlas y hacerlas cumplir en todas sus intervenciones profesionales.  \n\n\n\nCumplimiento de promesa: \n\nSignifica entregar correcta y oportunamente el servicio acordado. Aunque ambos requisitos (entrega correcta y oportuna) pueden parecer diferentes, los clientes han mencionado que ambos tienen igual importancia, pues provocan su confianza o desconfianza hacia la empresa. En opinión del cliente, la confianza es lo más importante en materia de servicio.  \n\nGerencia: Toma de Decisiones, \n\nEl modo de pensar del gerente sobre las cosas, las personas y las organizaciones, es un factor crítico para el mejoramiento de la calidad, la productividad y la integración del personal. El centro de la gerencia, es el ser humano, aquél al que se sirve y aquél que sirve, pudiéndose conceptualizar que al que se sirve, se paga un servicio o acude al servicio y espera calidad, y pagará o acudirá con mayor devoción en la medida en que este satisfecho.

My goal was to craft a design that mirrors the complexity and precision of auto repair, showcasing my expertise and the detailed attention I give to each vehicle.\n\nI selected a black and white color scheme to project the professionalism and dependability of my services. This timeless combination ensures clarity and readability, while also conveying a sense of elegance and meticulousness that reflects my approach to auto repair.\n\nFor the text elements, I chose a robust \"Auto Repair & Maintenance\" headline in the eye-catching INTRO RUST BASE SHADE font at a size of 33 to grab attention. The sub-headline \"Services Offered\" is set in the MULLER font at a size of 22, maintaining its importance without overpowering the main headline. To highlight our special promotion, I placed \"20% off\" inside a conspicuous red decagon, designed to stand out and capture the interest of potential customers.\n\nI used the Binate font for the list of services, at a size 11, for its readability and to keep the layout neat and tidy. The hexagonal theme extends to the images: a car engine and a mechanic at work, which represent the breadth of services I offer, and a car tire to emphasize my expertise in vehicle maintenance.\n\nBlue lines are used to create distinct visual sections within the flyer, guiding the reader's eye through the content, and a blue rectangle accentuates the promotional text, providing a splash of color against the monochromatic theme. The background with a photo of my garage immediately contextualizes the services being advertised.\n\nMy logo, Sandong's Garage Auto Repair, is prominently placed in the bottom left to establish my brand identity. Every element of the design has been thoughtfully chosen and placed not just to convey the flyer's message, but also to attract and engage potential customers, reassuring them of the top-tier service they can expect at my garage."}],"conversation_id":"conv_0052"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2025-03-26T22:47:53.280164Z","updated_at":"2025-03-29T21:14:39.325028Z","inner_id":9,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":6,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":150,"annotations":[{"id":30,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["Turn

We're not just friends, we're sisters.\"\n\nSayori: \"I couldn't have done any of this without you. Thank you for being here for me.\"\n\nAs they bring their babies home and begin the journey of motherhood, they come together with their families and the rest of the group to celebrate the defeat of King Ghidorah, and the safety of the world.\n\nSayori's Mom: \"I'm so proud of you, Sayori. You're going to be a wonderful mother.\"\n\nCupa's Mom: \"And I'm so proud of you, Cupa. Burasuto is going to grow up to be strong and brave just like his mother.\"\n\nAs Cupa and Sayori's families grow closer together, they know that their friendship will continue to thrive and that their babies will grow up as close as they did - proving that being close friends and family truly runs in their blood."}],"conversation_id":"conv_0055"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2025-03-26T22:47:53.280301Z","updated_at":"2025-03-29T21:33:51.806999Z","inner_id":10,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":6,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":151,"annotations":[{"id":31,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["Turn
